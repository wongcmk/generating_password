PASSWORD GENERATOR 

Description: A password is randomly generated based on user-selected criteria that the user enters into the space when prompted.  This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for password length. If outside the range of 8-128, 'Try again' will prompt up and the prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number. 

If outside the range, it will promt out alert to request a new password length within the range required.

The program then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box. 

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
